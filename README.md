FoodyCall.us
============

Use our intuitive system to skip the line and the wait at Summies and Late Night! FoodyCall, available at http://foodycall.us, is an interface for ordering from these Wesleyan dining locations remotely. The entire menus are available for viewing and choosing from. Users also have the option to add ratings after they have received their orders.

To run the application locally:
1. Populate the menu database by navigating to FoodyCall/lib/populate and running "populate.py".
2. Return to the main directory and run "python runserver.py" to run the application. It will be available at localhost:3000.
